# CICD-PIP-JENKINS-GITHUBACTION
CICD pipeline using Jenkins and Github


In Jenkins, the term "workspace" is used to refer to the directory where Jenkins builds your project. By default, each job has its own workspace. 

The `WORKSPACE` environment variable in Jenkins contains the absolute path of this workspace directory. So, when you use `${WORKSPACE}` in your Jenkins pipeline script, it gets replaced by the path of the current job's workspace directory.

In your script, `${WORKSPACE}` is used to specify the location of the files that you want to copy to your EC2 instance. The line `sh "scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${WORKSPACE}/* ${EC2_HOST}:${REMOTE_DIR}"` is copying all files from the current job's workspace directory to the `REMOTE_DIR` directory on your EC2 instance.

This is useful because the workspace directory is where your project's files are located after the `git` step clones your repository. So, `${WORKSPACE}/*` represents all the files in your project.

Please note that the `scp` command requires SSH access to your EC2 instance. The `sshagent(['aws-ec2-cred'])` line in your script is providing these SSH credentials. You need to replace `'aws-ec2-cred'` with the ID of your actual SSH credentials in Jenkins. 

Also, please remember to handle all sensitive data securely, especially when dealing with remote servers and access credentials.


'Deploy' stage more dynamic by adding more conditions in the `when` block. The `expression` in the `when` block is a Groovy script that should return a boolean value. If it returns `true`, the stage is executed. If it returns `false`, the stage is skipped.

In your case, you want the 'Deploy' stage to execute only if the 'Test' stage is successful and the current workspace is as expected. Here's how you can do it:

```groovy
stage('Deploy') {
    when {
        expression {
            // Check if the previous stage (Test) was successful
            def isTestSuccessful = currentBuild.resultIsBetterOrEqualTo('SUCCESS')
            // Check if the current workspace is as expected
            def isWorkspaceCorrect = (WORKSPACE == '/expected/workspace/path')
            // Return true only if both conditions are met
            return isTestSuccessful && isWorkspaceCorrect
        }
    }
    steps {
        // Your deployment steps go here
    }
}
```

In this script, replace `'/expected/workspace/path'` with the expected path of your workspace. This script checks if the 'Test' stage was successful and if the current workspace is the expected one. If both conditions are met, it proceeds with the 'Deploy' stage.
ase and environment. For example, you might want to add more conditions or make the conditions more complex. Always test your scripts in a safe and controlled environment before deploying them in production. 

Also, please note that running commands with `sudo` might require password authentication, depending on your server's sudoers configuration. If that's the case, you might need to adjust the script to handle password prompts or configure your server to allow passwordless sudo for specific commands. 

Remember to handle any sensitive information such as email addresses and IP addresses securely. It's generally a good practice to use Jenkins credentials or environment variables to handle sensitive data. 

This script assumes that you have `sshagent` and `mail` steps properly configured in your Jenkins server. If not, you might need to install and configure the necessary plugins. 

Always test your scripts in a safe and controlled environment before deploying them in production.
